  <h1>Customer Support Response - Redirect by User Agent</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer Question:</strong> I want to redirect visitor with specific user agent (*MSIE 8.0* for example) to a different page. Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</p>

  <h2>Response:</h2>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Thanks for reaching out.You’re right – Cloudflare Page Rules don’t support redirection based on User Agent. However, you can achieve this behavior using a Cloudflare Worker.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>

  <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
    <p>Cloudflare Workers allow you to inspect request headers and implement custom logic, including redirection based on User Agent string.</p>
  
  <h2>Tools Used:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloudflare Workers – to inspect headers and respond conditionally</li>
    </ul>
