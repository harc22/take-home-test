  <h1>Customer Support Response - Nameservers</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer Question:</strong> How are Cloudflare's nameservers different from the DNS provided by Google DNS or OpenDNS? 
      Can I delegate to Cloudflare nameservers while still using my host’s DNS?</p>

  <h2>Response:</h2>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Thanks for reaching out. Cloudflare's nameservers differ from services like Google DNS or OpenDNS 
      in that Cloudflare acts as your authoritative DNS provider, not just a resolver. 
      This means Cloudflare manages your DNS records and responds to queries on behalf of your domain. 
      Regarding the second question, since Cloudflare is your sole authoritative DNS provider that means
      that all DNS records must be managed in Cloudflare and your host’s DNS cannot be used.
    </p>
    <p>Hope this answers your question.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Hugo Cabrita</p>

  <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
    <p>You can’t delegate only partially to Cloudflare. Once Cloudflare nameservers are set at the registrar level, 
      all DNS must be managed via Cloudflare. You can import existing records from your host to avoid disruption.</p>
