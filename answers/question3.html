  <h1>Customer Support Response - Workers Not Applied</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer Question:</strong> I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: 
    it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</p>

  <h2>Response:</h2>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Thanks for reaching out. If your Worker works in the debugger but not when you access the live site, 
    the most common issue is that the route isn't correctly configured. Please check that the Worker is 
    deployed and bound to the correct route (e.g. <code>customer-website.com</code>).</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Hugo Cabrita</p>

  <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
    <p>Workers must be associated with a route to be applied to live traffic. 
      The debugger runs the Worker code in isolation, so route binding is not required there. This mismatch is often the root cause.</p>
  
  <h2>Tools Used:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloudflare Workers Dashboard â€“ to confirm deployment and route binding</li>
    </ul>
