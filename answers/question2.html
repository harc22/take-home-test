  <h1>Customer Support Response - Why Is My Site Coming from California?</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer Question:</strong> I’m in London, but looking at your IPs it shows that you are serving my website from California. 
      Can that be right? Why is that? I thought you were supposed to serve my website from some places close to me?</p>

  <h2>Response:</h2>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <p>Thanks for reaching out. Cloudflare operates in a way that allows us to cache and serve your content from multiple data centers worldwide. 
      When you check the IPs, you may see one of our edge locations serving content. This is normal and part of Cloudflare’s routing to improve performance.
      It is also possible that it is happening because of your ISP routing or heavy load on the nearby edges.</p>
    <p>If for any reason you experience any performance issues, please let us know so we can promptly provide assistance.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Hugo Cabrita</p>

  <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
    <p> Assumed that Cloudflare automatically chooses the closest data center to serve content based on the location of the customer. 
      If the customer is located in London, typically Cloudflare should serve the website from a nearby European data center. 
      However, if the Californian server is the chosen edge location is because it was determined as optimal in terms of performance.</p>

  <h2>Tools I Used:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloudflare Analytics</strong> – to check geographical routing and data center selection</li>
    </ul>
